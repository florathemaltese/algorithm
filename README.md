## Algorithm Collection

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of various algorithms implemented in Java. Each algorithm is organized into its own directory and includes a detailed implementation. The purpose of this collection is to provide a comprehensive set of examples for different algorithmic challenges and use cases.

# Algorithms Included
BinaryTreeFlipper: Flips a binary tree in a specific manner, changing its structure.
CountOccurrences: Counts the occurrences of elements in a data structure.
MazeShortestPathSolver: Finds the shortest path in a maze from a starting point to a destination.
MeetingSchedulerVerifier: Checks if a person can attend all scheduled meetings without overlapping.
PreorderBSTVerifier: Verifies if a given array is a valid preorder traversal of a Binary Search Tree.
SearchTarget: Implements searching algorithms to find targets in data structures.
SubarraySumVerifier: Counts the number of subarrays where the sum is greater than half of its length.
UnivalSubtreeCounter: Counts the number of unival (single-value) subtrees in a binary tree.
FileReadWriter: Provides functionality to read from and write to files.
WeightedGrade: Calculates weighted grades based on provided criteria.
